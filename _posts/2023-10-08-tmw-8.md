**week 9**:
- Cure Dolly: at 60th vid
- Yuru Camp: at 10th ep (i'm so close to finishing this anime!)
- Yotsubato: at page 69 (stopped here because it seemed like a good stopping point due to fact that it barely has anything on it + funny number)
- Anki: still been doing the decks consistently. Recently, I discovered something called FSRS. Apparently, it's an algorithm that's allegedly better than Anki's one. I'm considering using it. By the way, I also found Jo-Mako's Cure Dolly grammar decks by some means. It looks incredibly promising, since (I'll be honest) I barely remember anything after the Cure Dolly videos despite the huge sum of time I spend on them.

I acknowledge that I'm moving at a snail's pace, and I'm intent on changing that. I will do my utmost to avoid procrastinating and being distracted while immersing.

I expect to have completed UsagiSpoon by 2 weeks from now. Then, I will do the Kotoba thingy in this server and see how I fare.
