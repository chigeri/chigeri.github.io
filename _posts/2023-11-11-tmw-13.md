it's me again
it's as though it's been forever since my last weekly report.
**week 14**:
_anki_:  good (?). Core is good(90% retention/only 620 cards left). RTK is good(retention ok :thumbsup: ). DOJG is good(pretty manageable). Usagi  Phonetics... not so much :orz:. I'd never seen the components in the deck prior to doing it, so I struggled lots (40min+ on just this one deck) Thank god the hellspawn deck is only 120 cards. More and I'd have dropped dead half way through.

_immersion_: Tsuyuchiru Letter at 20k words now. pretty good progress, or so I think. According to information I found online, the whole game is 120k words, so I'm already 1/6 done with it. Hopefully the info I got is accurate.

_quiz_: I can pass the student quiz reliably now. Trainee pb is 34. Getting it next week. Probably.

Did I miss anything? I don't know. It can't have been anything important anyway, right? Alright, that's it for this week. Next one, I'm going to be pretty busy (again... such is life...). Though I don't intend on using that as an excuse to laze around.
