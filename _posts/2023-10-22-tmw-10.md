**week 11**:
I switched to Angel Beats after finishing season 1 of Yuru Camp. Originally, I wanted to save this series for later since I heard that it's very high in sentimental value. As much as I want to not watch the thing, for fear of not understanding stuff and ruining the story for myself, I watched it anyway. The voices inside me won. 

So... I watched on average a little more than 1 episode a day. 1 on each of the weekdays and 2 on each of the weekends, equaling to 9 episodes. 4 more to do.

anki still good. an hour a day on average. I also recently completed rrtk450. feelsgoodman

by the way, i learned how to write numbers. Not a huge achievement by itself, since the number system in japanese is pretty logical, but still something, right?
For instance: 420 is yon hyaku ni juu, 69 is roku juu kuu (number 9 pronounced as kuu or kyu i'm not sure myself)

i think that's it for this week.
upcoming weeks are going to have me quite occupied though, with there being so many tests at school for me to get through.

i'll try my best to keep myself alive until it's all over :NanaYay:
