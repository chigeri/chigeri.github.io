long time no making weekly report
this is going to be a long one
**week 12 + 13**:
as you might already know, i had exams these 2 weeks. I pulled through somehow.  That said, I still did pretty bad on literature and physics. Not something I'm too proud of. English was a walk in the park for me though, as I live in a non-english-speaking country and the exam here is mostly just grammar and vocabulary.

There's really not much use lamenting... By the way, did you notice the new role i got? the student role? pretty cool, right? i barely passed the thing after a whopping 3 attempts (got 9 wrong, so one more incorrect and I would have faced my demise). I never knew getting a role could be so motivating. I'm getting that Eternal Idol role eventually. (might sound funny, but is there a possibility for a role even higher than eternal to be created? like, 'super idol'?)

Yotsubato vol 1 99% completion. And no, I'm not going to read the table of contents and the long text at the end and whatnot to get that last 1%. 
Angel Beats, watched all of it. Replayed some scenes. Did not understand much since I spent only around 40 minutes per episode. Still bawled my eyes out anyway.

I added two new decks, which were recommended in the TMW website, to my anki. On-yomi reading of words deck, and DOJG grammar deck. There's a pretty huge problem: all 4 decks combined consume way too much of my time (2 hours). The one that hogs up the most time is the onyomi reading deck. Despite having finished RTK450, all the kanji introduced in this new deck looks like scribble to me, and I can't associate the reading with the corresponding kanji as fast as I'd like. Should I lower the number of new cards per deck after all?

I also picked up Tsuyuchiru Letter as my 1st VN. Yeah, the one introduced in the # announcements . I got my text-hooking setup working and got through 5000 words. I'll finish the game soon enough, preferably before new year

omg i'm reaching the word limit. guess this is it. bye
