exhausting week.
**week 15**
let's see...
*Anki*: Most of the free time I could squeeze out of my tight schedule this week was spent on doing anki. I had to drop usagi phonetics and reduce the cards in DOJG down to just 5 daily in order to keep up. Though I increased the new card count in Core to 25 daily to compensate (somewhat).

*Immersion*: Tsuyuchiru letter 25k words. Yeah I only read 5k this week lol. 
I haven't been watching anime or reading manga either. I'm thinking of watching Teasing master Takagi-san (ss1 & ss2) since it's both an easy watch (allegedly), and is available on animelon.

I wouldn't have been able to do anything at all with my jam-packed schedule if it hadn't been for the Forest app & extension :deciduous_tree: :christmas_tree: :evergreen_tree: :palm_tree: . It boosted my productivity tenfold by not allowing me to pick up my phone and procrastinate. I recommend you try it out. It's on the app store.

*quiz*: I messed up bad and scored... 15 on Trainee. I swear I'm going to destroy this lil piece of shit before it turns December. And one day it will be the Eternal quiz's turn...

||(Here, I wrote a bunch of things, complaining about how a research, a video shoot, a presentation, etc drained the life out of me, but I decided to delete all of them. Can't have negativity in my weekly report and ruin the mood of everyone reading stuff here, can I? :Yay:) ||
