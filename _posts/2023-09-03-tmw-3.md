week 4:
I've made the decision to just abandon the Tango N5 deck altogether. And no, I'm not stopping learning Japanese. It's just that I recently discovered the fact that I wasn't supposed to ONLY do the mentioned anki deck, but rather, do it *along with* grammar studies and immersion (I only knew this because I rechecked the guide on a whim). I was doing little of either of them, if any at all. 

All in all, I screwed up. 

So I thought I might as well just drop the general guide and jump to the UsagiSpoon guide (and yes I'm definitely reading the guide carefully this time around). Apparently this alternative guide is much more rigorous and demanding than the general guide but delivers more results over a shorter span of time. 
It's fine by me though. I have nearly 3 hours of free time a day. 

I'll see how it goes.
