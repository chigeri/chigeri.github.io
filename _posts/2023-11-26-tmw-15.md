idk what to say tbh
**week 16**:
pretty chill week. I didn't have many assignments, nor did I have tests. Though the finals were fast approaching(and still are). So I spent the majority of the week only studying, doing homework, and reviewing. I also drew while I were at it. This week's recap:
- anki: like usual
- visual novel: tsuyuchiru 25k > 35k. I can read somewhat faster while still understanding what the characters are saying
- anime: Teasing Master Takagi-san I haven't watched yet. I'll find time to watch it after the finals, I think.
- quiz: I still failed. 25/50 correct. It's gotta be next week. It's gotta be. 90% of gamblers quit before they hit it big.
