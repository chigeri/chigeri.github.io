These 2 weeks have been extremely exciting for me as I got to try many new things, and I’m proud of what I’ve done with regards to Japanese learning 😃!

**week 34 & 35**:  
## Yomininja  
It’s an incredible app that lets you OCR scan basically everything Japanese with insanely high accuracy. Not to mention, the latest version has Yomitan integrated, which allows you to add cards to Anki ON THE SPOT. No texthooking is needed. I’ve been using it to play games that just wouldn’t be playable with the usual texthooker setup, too (like Honkai Star Rail).

You can get Yomininja either at [GitHub](https://github.com/matt-m-o/YomiNinja) or the [creator's Patreon page](https://patreon.com/YomiNinja)

OCR-sama TSKR 🙏🙏🙏 

## Immersion  
Mainly games this time.   
### Game  
**Honkai Star Rail:** Playing this *used to be* nigh impossible for me because the difficulty was off the charts (many senpais here also agree). However…

Yomininja changes EVERYTHING. I no longer have to wring out all of my brain juice trying to understand words that I don’t know. Story quests, no problem. Stimulated Universe item descriptions, no problem. 1st Anniversary monopoly game, also no problem. 

**Granblue Fantasy:** The game might be old, but the story is still pretty fun to play. I like how there are stories dedicated to characters that I got through the gacha system. The ones I have played through (like ビカラ’s) were pretty light-hearted, maybe except for ニーア’s. 

I’ve also been having a blast gameplay-wise. The one most notable thing I did was probably asking the Japanese people in my guild for help (insert link to that one thread). After this one occurrence, I gained more confidence and talked to people in the guild more. (insert positive emoji)  
### Anime  
**Blue Archive Anime**: 1st episode was ABSOLUTE CINEMA. Cute and funny students. Killer opening song (the students’ seiyuus themselves sang it!!!) & animation (satisfyingly smooth & snappy!). Sensei’s hella handsome. What’s not to love?

**影の実力者になりたくて Season 2** Nothing could possibly top this anime. 12 episodes went by in a second. ||not the 500 cards I mined though :orz:||  
## Hindrance Riddance (sounds cool)
After watching a certain scene in episode 11 of 影の実力者になりたくて、I resolved to fix all the stuff that I shouldn’t be doing:  
1. **Distractions**: primarily Youtube (besides Youtube I don’t use social media much). I would always wind up watching dumb shitposts whenever I opened this damn app, so I blocked myself from using Youtube forever using Cold Turkey.  
2. **Yomitan scan button**: I’ve been too trigger-happy for my own good. Scanning words I did not know before even trying to parse the sentence is suboptimal, so I’ve stopped doing that.   

## Anki  
- **huge blunder**: I messed up big time and somehow set all cards in my deck (about 1500 at the time) to “to review”. Somehow, Ctrl + Z wasn’t the first thing I did. When I did realize that I should have just Ctrl + Z, it was too late because I restarted Anki. Well, doing 1500 review cards isn’t all too bad, right?   
- **30 cards a day consistently**: If I do any fewer than this, I’ll build up a massive Anki backlog really quickly.  

## Plans  
No plans. I’ve got my last exams for the school year coming next week and the week after, so I’m going to be really busy. I don’t expect to be able to immerse much, but I’ll try to slot in some time at the very least!
