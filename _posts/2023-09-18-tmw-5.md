i'd like to make this week's weekly report a little shorter because my schedule's been jam-packed with assignments (i hate them)
week 6:
overall, progress is slow.
Cure Dolly? I'm literally a dozen videos slow. At least I don't replay the same videos a million times this time around.  
Anki decks? Been doing them consistently. nearly 50 minutes a day to complete both core 2.3k and RRTK450.
JP immersion? Got to page 20 of Yotsubato. As for anime-watching, I dropped Eromanga-sensei after 4 episodes and jumped to Yuru Camp (Laid Back Camp or whatever in English). It's slow-paced, but not boring at all. I'm not going to write a whole review about the anime, considering the fact that I'm only at the 3rd episode. I'm planning on watching New Game! after being done with it.

BTW, I see people posting the anki statistics here. Should I do the same?
