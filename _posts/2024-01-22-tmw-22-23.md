2 weeks have already gone by, eh?
**week 22 & 23**:
-    Tsuyuchiru finally done! I still read pretty slowly, at a pace of only around 3500 characters per hour, but I’m confident that I understand a majority of what I read (only for Tsuyuchiru, might not be the same for other visual novels). 
-    I’ve mined roughly a hundred words after setting up jpmn and fixing all the problems with it!
-    I plan on reading ToToNo (jp name:君と彼女と彼女の恋) right after finishing Takagi season 1(currently 3/12)

dumb story below, read if you want:

||I now have a new computer! It runs Windows 10, which is pretty much better than the Windows 7 I’d been using up until this replacement in every aspect there is||

||Transferring all my data from the old machine to this new one, reinstalling many apps that were removed after the computer replacement, and all that jazz, were all a pain in the neck, though. Just that took nearly a whole week for me to do. Things surely are tough for the technically inept like me…||

||I found that I can make whatever word I scan w/ yomitan jump straight to Anki (kind of), using the power of AnkiConnect. I asked around in question forum channel, and luckily, some kind people helped this poor guy out. At first, I tried to follow xelieu’s guide, as recommended by one of the helpers. I followed all the steps perfectly, but just couldn’t get the green button to work somehow. Desperate, I tried arbyste’s guide in hopes of getting it to work somehow, but was to no avail. After nearly 2 days of by-myself troubleshooting, I still couldn’t get it to work. Turned out it was a browser problem, and not me-following-instructions-incorrectly problem. As a result, I had to go through the trouble of switching from Brave to another browser.||

||One thing that also gave me a big headache is the jpmn frequency sort error. I still can’t believe I spent 3 hours just trying to copy paste marv’s freq sort handlebar. I kept on pasting it in the wrong place by some mysterious means…||
