before i dived into the tango N5 deck, i gave the TheMoeWay guide a quick reread, and it suddenly dawned on me that I had to learn some grammar first. The guy who made the guide literally said that it's up to me to decide how much grammar I wanted to learn, so I learned a little... too much grammar. I regret not having started the anki deck sooner. Like, I could always just continue learning grammar while I do the deck.  Oh well, it happened. Can't do anything about that.

Though I regret spending so much time on grammar, being able to make some actual some sentences is pretty cool. Here, I'll demonstrate:
1.  The wristwatch I bought yesterday is being broken by the naughty dog.
> やんちゃな犬は私がきのうかったうでどけいをこわしている。
2. I throw the book which Tanaka is reading at Sakura.
> わたしはたなかよんでいるほんをさくらになげる。

i guess I'm going to keep learning kanji from the deck for now.
