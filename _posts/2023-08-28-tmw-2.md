I know I'm supposed to write this yesterday (sunday), but I was just too sick and weak then to do so. I'm a lot better now.

week 3:
this week was a complete disaster. I did not do much. My computer speakers broke on Monday (the new ones still haven't arrived), and I contracted some random diseases half way through the week. I was doing tasks at 40% the usual pace, and once I was finally done with the urgent / important things, i'd have little time to spare for my beloved Tango N5 deck. After the entirety of this 7-day period (or should i say 8 since yknow), my kanji vocabulary improved by a marginal amount. To make it worse, I didn't understand the usage of the particle ni/he/de due to me not watching enough of Cure Dolly videos, so that made the entire process of learning words and stuff much more confusing. 

Maybe I should have been more wary of my health. Well, at least I know that now.
I feel ashamed writing this. I will do better this week.

TL;DR: terrible week. terrible progression
