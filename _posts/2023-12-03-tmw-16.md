I've spent a good amount of time drawing this week, so less Japanese in exchange. Still a good week tho. perhaps.
**week 17**:
- anki: Core only 125 cards left (5 days left 25 cards a day). I still haven't resumed doing DOJG and Usagi Phonetics. Will do once I'm done with Core. 
- Visual Novel: Tsuyuchiru 35k -> 45k. I'm thinking of sprinting to 100k before New Year. I have exactly 4 weeks left, so if I distribute the huge number equally it'd be around 15k words/week. I think it's pretty doable. I'm still pretty sad it's not possible to complete my very first visual novel before 2024.
- Anime: Teasing Master still on hold. Idk if I'll be able to watch even an episode with the finals looming around the corner.    
- quiz: guess what?
||wahahaha i'm no longer a mere Student. i finally graduated idol school and is now on my way to turn into a fully-fledged idol after becoming a Trainee. i will study extra hard so that my talent does not go unnoticed. By doing this I will eventually get scouted by a small up-and-coming production company. They are going to take me under their wing and i will be a part of a bona fide idol team as a promising Debut Idol. And when that happens i'm gonna do so many banger performances that the entire idol market becomes monopolized by me and my company only. In no time, i'll become a Major Idol... and a Prima Idol... and then a Divine Idol... and ultimately mark my name in history as one of the Eternal Idols, earning the respect and admiration of everyone. btw you didn't just read all of this mess did you? if you did i'm sorry||
:Yay: :Yay: :Yay:
