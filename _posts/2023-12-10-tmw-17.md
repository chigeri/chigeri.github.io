Finals are coming in 2 weeks. I've got a lot of stuff to do.

**week 17** :
- anki: I finally finished Core 2.3k. Though I said I'd resume doing DOJG & Usagi Phonetics after completing Core, with how much stuff I have to do right now, it's probably not possible. Or maybe it is but I don't want to put too much stress on myself.

- Visual Novel: Tsuyuchiru Letter 45k->60k. I thought I could push through and get to 69k for the funny number but I couldn't. What a shame lol.

- quiz: it's all over :orz: . ||I hadn't known that I could get turned back into a student before I did the student quiz this week as some kind of warm-up for the debut quiz. Obviously, I re-became a student. Last week's successful attempt was girigiri so I wasn't being too confident when I redid trainee. Then I absolutely tanked the first 5 questions somehow and failed the trainee quiz.||

- plans for the future: It's not New Year yet, but I made a lot of goals for 2024. There are goals for both Japanese drawing and my other hobby: drawing. I'm going to do them in tandem with each other. 

I'm aware that progress on the quizzes won't be as linear as when I first started out since I'm no longer are going to be learning "Core" vocabulary (that is, words most commonly used). However, I think I can become a Debut by May and a Major Idol by September 2024. 
||perhaps a little ambitious, but maybe I can even become prima. I mean, I literally have 10+ hours a day for Japanese once it's summer|| 

How? By completing at least 7 different Animes and 7 different Visual Novels by September.
I will never stop progressing. I will get that good light blue role. 

This will be my LAST weekly report this year, probably.
I expect to have finished Tsuyuchiru by the 1st of January 2024.
