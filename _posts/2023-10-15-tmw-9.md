 i'm not gonna make another lengthy and overly formal (at least in my eyes) weekly report again üëç
**week 10**:
- Yuru Camp: done with the series (i was thinking about watching season 2, but animelon doesn't have it and i'm too lazy to actually set up the subtitles thingy)
- Anki: still good, at 400 mature cards rn (2.3k Core deck)
- Yotsubato: also finished the 100 pages (i'm going to keep going until i finish the volume)
- Cure Dolly: at 74th video (i do keep count of what i watch, in case i haven't written this already)

Usagispoon is pretty much done, just some more Cure Dolly videos to go through. (maybe something but i forgor :skull: )

Now near the end of all this, I can read way more Japanese + at a way faster speed compared to when I first started. This past 1 month and a half has been quite fun. 

well then, until next week üëç
