## Immersion
### Bocchi the ~~pebble~~ GUITAR SHREDDER
8 episodes.
The first 8 episodes were an incredible experience. More than just your average slice of life anime, or bocchi twitter memes, or “bocchi’s me fr”, Bocchi the Rock is about the conviction of Bocchi to get past her character flaws (with fire music on top). Instant 10/10. Anime’s still my favorite medium to immerse in.

### Blue Archive anime
2 episodes: 6 & 7. The first was a fight-focused episode, and the latter a fanservice-based. I’m getting impatient from all the wait for the explosive climax already 😭💢
### ToToNo
I read for one hour to test out exstatic before work came up and I had to pause it. I haven’t had a chance to read until now. 
### Listening
I read Karikurai’s [Listening advice](https://discord.com/channels/617136488840429598/1241459943975157821) and decided to give it a try. 

I gotta say that it was an enlightening experience for me. Watching anime used to take me at least an hour, and up to 3, for 1 episode, but just watching it raw like this cut down the time to merely 20 which is also how long one episode is. Besides, the episode feels less dry and more alive, too. Really lets you “immerse” in the moment. Maybe this is what immersion is truly about?

I’m going to do listening practice like this more in the future.
## Misc

### Serious pitch accent study henceforth
So one morning I was trying to do some anki while listening to music, but that didn’t work out. Because of that I tried putting on KanjiEater’s Darius interview podcast episode in the background. Talk about 一石二鳥！

In the interview, Darius mentioned how important pitch accent is, and that he made a little guide to pitch accent a while back (2022) that we can check out. It’s awesome. Here if you want: 
[Strategies for Acquiring Pitch Accent in Japanese - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-dRbTnLmBY)

To get better at pitch accent, it’s vital that I start learning words along with their pitch accent one by one from now on. Otherwise, it’s gonna be tough later on. I suppose there’s a reason why words in JPMN are color-coded, after all. I kinda regret neglecting those, tbh.

And I must also do some corrected reading sessions, too. Of course being the poor guy that I am, I can’t afford one-on-one italki lessons online. However, I can always ask the kind senpais in TMW server for help if the need arises. I’m sure someone will help me out if I ask nicely. Probably.
### Discovery about irregular readings (?)
率 has two onyomi readings, そつ and りつ, right? But from what I’ve observed, words which takes the “lead” meaning of 率 has the reading そつ, while ones which takes the “ratio” meaning has the りつ reading.

So my theory is that what I’ve always thought were irregularity in leading were simply caused by a meaning difference. But I still need to find more evidence to support this outrageous theory of mine, tho. Really interesting.
