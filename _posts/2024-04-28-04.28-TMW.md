It’s been scorching hot these past few days, and I’ve been having tests one after another, so I’ve been coming up with all sort of excuses not to submit this in time. Temperature hovering at around 36 degrees with near 0% air humidity is not very conducive to productivity so that probably can’t be helped. Anyway…

**week 36 & 37:**
Probably the most fun i’ve had learning Japanese. Definitely not the most productive, though. 

## Overview
- Anki: 1648 cards mined collection-wide (+ ~120 cards)
- Anki streak: 64 days
- Anki new cards/day: 25
- Time on Anki/day: ~ 20 mins

- Anime: ~ 2 hours 
- VN(プルアカ ): ~ 5 hours (character count N/A bc text not hookable)
- Song singalongs: ~ 10 songs
- MVs: ~ 10 videos

## Immersion

### Music
not sure how helpful, but at least I had fun 😊
#### Singing along

In the 1st week I had some last assignments for the school year before the finals. I did these assignments while singing along to songs on my Spotify (namely: ソラゴトby 明透, ごめんね by AYANE, 夜迷い言 by HACHI, etc.). 

Songs I listened to weren’t particularly fast, so with some practice, I could sing in sync with the singers just fine. 

This is something that I’ve always wanted to try, so I was very glad that I could sing Japanese songs to some extent 🎶

I still can’t sing something like 赤い洗礼 by Albemuth though. I was literally thinking, “who put Chinese in my Japanese song??” as I listened to it.

At some point I thought about mining words from songs, but decided against it. If I did then the listening experience would be ruined, wouldn't it?

#### Music Videos
Aside from singing along to songs, being able to read highly stylized and animated captions have also been among the top reasons I started learning Japanese in the first place. So I gave that a try too.

For now, if lyrics appear at a “reasonable” pace then I will be able to read it. Something like Empty old City’s Chronicle A, for example.

Suisei’s Ghost lyrics appearance speed isn’t too bad, but for the entirety of the song the lyrics are too handwriting-ish for me. But I’m getting there! I got a little emotional listening to this, because I listened to this song for the first time when it went live almost exactly 3 years ago. I couldn’t understand a single word, then; but now that I do (somewhat), this song hits a lot harder.

### Blue archive
truly one of the franchises of all time

#### Blue Archive the anime
It's just... so peak🔥. Wild roller-coaster of emotions for me. Many cute and funny scenes. The nostalgic ED had me shed a tear. Originally, I was going to include some of my thoughts about the ED, but it ended up becoming a 300-word essay so I scrapped that idea.

By the way, I just gotta mention that I barely did any lookups for the 3rd episode. I kinda miss when I had to do lookups every 1 sentence in 影の実力者になりたくて already. feelsarchiveman.

#### Blue Archive the game
“-ive alive” musical event ongoing! I spent roughly 5 hours reading the first 10 chapters of the event story at a rather lax pace. 

There were a lot of dialogues in the first half, but there weren’t as much in the 2nd. They did surprise me with a 3D animated MV (to which I also sang along) in the 8th chapter, though. I loved it.

### TenSuRa 3rd season
I watched the first 2 episodes. I'm going to be honest: it was mid and so I dropped it. Nothing much to say for the show. 

The characters did utilize a diverse range of vocabulary so I could learn quite a bit from them.

## plans for summer!
I’m gonna be done with all my tests after this week, which means… 3-month SUMMER BREAK. So here are my goals for this summer (subjective to change):
- finish entire Blue Archive main story
- finish ToToNo (3 months untouched…)
- finish Hamidashi
- finish Summer Pockets (and then conclude my summer?)  

All that while balancing with doing courses and doing othe hobbies. I think it's going to be a little tough. But then again, if I think of this as fun then it won't be daunting.
